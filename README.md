# APOD
This project utilizes the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API provided by NASA to retrieve captivating images from the cosmos.
The APOD API allows you to fetch a wide range of astronomy-related images based on a specified date, and it offers features such as single date search,
date range search, and the option to obtain high-resolution images.<br>

## Getting Started
To begin using the NASA APOD API, follow these steps:
1. Sign up for a NASA API key by visiting [NASA API Registration](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#signUp).

2. Once you have the API make sure to replace YOUR_NASA_API_KEY in the API_KEY variable in the JavaScript file.
```javascript
const API_KEY = "YOUR_NASA_API_KEY"
```
